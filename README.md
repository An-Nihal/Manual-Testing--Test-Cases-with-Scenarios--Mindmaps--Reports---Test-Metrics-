## Introduction
In manual testing, it is crucial to have well-defined test cases, detailed scenarios, visual representations, insightful reports, and meaningful test metrics. This repository aims to provide a centralized location for organizing and documenting these artifacts to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of manual testing projects.
## Test Cases
The test-cases directory contains a collection of test cases written for different features or modules of the system under test. Each test case should include the following information:

- Test case ID
- Test case description
- Pre-requisites
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Actual results (to be filled during test execution)

Test cases are essential for ensuring thorough test coverage and providing a clear roadmap for manual testing.
## Scenarios
The scenarios consists of detailed scenarios that represent different user workflows or use cases within the system. Scenarios help testers understand the system's behavior from end-users' perspectives and ensure that all user interactions are thoroughly tested.
## Mindmaps
The mindmaps contains visual representations in the form of mindmaps. These mindmaps serve as a visual aid to understand the test coverage, dependencies between different features, and potential areas of focus during testing. Testers can use mindmaps to brainstorm ideas, track testing progress, and identify any gaps in their testing efforts.
## Reports
The reports are dedicated to storing various reports generated during manual testing. Reports may include defect reports, test execution reports, test summary reports, and any other relevant documentation. These reports provide valuable insights into the testing progress, identified issues, and overall test results.
## Test Metrics
The test-metrics contains metrics and measurements related to manual testing. Testers can track metrics such as test coverage, defect density, test execution time, and other relevant metrics to assess the quality and progress of testing activities. The metrics help identify areas of improvement and provide quantitative data for making informed decisions.
## FAQ

#### Q1: How can I contribute to this project?

Answer: Contributions are welcome! You can contribute by adding new test cases, scenarios, mindmaps, reports, or test metrics to the respective directories. Simply open an issue or submit a pull request with your proposed changes.

#### Q2:  Can I use the test cases and scenarios provided in this repository for my own projects?

Answer: Absolutely! The test cases and scenarios in this repository are meant to be shared and used as a reference for manual testing projects. Feel free to adapt and utilize them for your own testing efforts.

#### Q3: Is there a specific format or template to follow for test cases?

Answer: While there isn't a strict template to follow, we recommend including the test case ID, description, pre-requisites, test steps, and expected results. You can also add any additional fields that are relevant to your project. Consistency in format across test cases will make it easier to navigate and understand the test suite.

#### Q4: Are all Test processes integrated in one file?

Answer: Yes. In the excel file you can see test cases, scenarios, mindmaps, test report and test metrics. All in one.
